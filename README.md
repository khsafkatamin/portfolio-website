# 🧭 Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website that showcases my projects, experience, and work in AI, robotics, and software development. The site includes an interactive chatbot powered by **[Google’s Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/)**, dynamic project data loaded from **[Supabase](https://supabase.com/)**, and a responsive interface built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.  

The initial project structure and theme were generated using **[Bolt AI App Builder](https://bolt.new/)**, which provided a solid base for the layout and design. The chatbot’s basic architecture and prompt flow were developed using **[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)**, and the application was then extensively customized locally — integrating backend support, AI capabilities, and optimized UI components.
